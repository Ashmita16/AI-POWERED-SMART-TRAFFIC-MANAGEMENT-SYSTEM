# AI-POWERED-SMART-TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
An AI-powered traffic management system that dynamically adjusts signal timings based on vehicle density and emergency vehicle detection.



The main moto of this project is:
Dynamic Traffic Signal Control using Video – Detects forward-moving vehicles from uploaded videos using YOLOv8, SORT, OpenCV, and adjusts traffic light durations dynamically with a Streamlit interface.

Emergency Vehicle Detection using Image – Identifies emergency vehicles (like ambulances) from uploaded images using YOLOv8, Tesseract OCR, and OpenCV, then prioritizes signal timing accordingly through Streamlit.
